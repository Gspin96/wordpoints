# Reporting a bug #

If you find a bug in the plugin, please report it here. Before opening a new issue,
always be sure that you have searched the existing issues to make sure your bug is
new. In your report be as detailed as possible, and be sure to include a list of
steps to reproduce the bug. Please also give as much information as you can about
your WordPress install and its envireonment: WordPress and PHP versions, active
plugins, etc.

Whatever you do, never, ever report a bug for an old version of WordPoints. Make sure
that you have the latest version installed before filing an issue. If possible, test
that the bug exists in the development trunk, too.

If you aren't sure what all that means (or sometimes maybe even if you are) you
should probably seek help in the [support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpoints)
instead.
